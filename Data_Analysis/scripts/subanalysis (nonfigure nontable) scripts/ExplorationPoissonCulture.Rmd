Does a Poisson probability model match the pattern of results that we see for 
the probability of a positive culture based on RNA copy number? 
Let P be the probability of a postive culture. 
Let N be the number of RNA copies
Let lambda be the probablity of infection per RNA copy. 
Then, P = 1 - exp(-lambda * N)
When P = 0.5 = 1 - exp(-lambda * N), exp(-lambda*N) = 0.5,
-lambda*N = ln(0.5),
lambda = -ln(0.5)/N

```{r lambda}
N_MTS <- 10^5.9
N_sal <- 10^6.7
lambda_MTS <- -log(0.5)/N_MTS
lambda_sal <- -log(0.5)/N_sal

lambda_MTS
lambda_sal

```

We will plot P on N, with N as log10 RNA copies



```{r Prob Plot, echo=FALSE}
N <- seq.int(2,9,0.1)
N <- 10^N
P_MTS <- 1 - exp(-lambda_MTS*N)
plot(P_MTS~log10(N))
```
